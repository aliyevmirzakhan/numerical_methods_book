<p>This chapter contains reference sections for several libraries that make up the <em>Scientific Python</em> ecosystem, sometimes called the <em>Python Data Science Ecosystem</em>.  These include libraries for efficient computing over large arrays of data, common numerical routines such as linear algebra solvers, interpolation, integration, etc. as well libraries for creating various scientific visualizations.</p>
<p>The chapter only covers the few core libraries that many others depend on.  The entire Scientific Python suite of libraries doesn't have a precise definition, but it typically can be though of as all of those that are installed by default with the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda Python Distribution</a>.</p>
